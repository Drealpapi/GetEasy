# ✅ Nigeria Locations Update Complete

## Changes Made

### 1. Location Data Updated
- ✅ `src/shared/constants/locations.ts` - Changed to Nigerian states and cities
- ✅ `src/shared/constants/usStatesData.ts` - Replaced US data with Nigerian data

### 2. Nigerian States Included (37 States + FCT)
All 36 states plus Federal Capital Territory (FCT) with major cities:

**Popular Cities:**
- Lagos (Lagos State)
- Abuja (FCT)
- Kano (Kano State)
- Port Harcourt (Rivers State)
- Ibadan (Oyo State)
- Kaduna (Kaduna State)
- Benin City (Edo State)
- Enugu (Enugu State)

### 3. Files Using Location Data
These files now automatically use Nigerian locations:
- `src/features/user/screens/LocationSearchScreen.tsx`
- `src/features/provider/screens/ProviderProfileScreen.tsx`
- `src/shared/components/LocationSelector.tsx`

### 4. API Compatibility
- Function names remain the same (`getAllUSStates`, `getCitiesByState`)
- No code changes needed in components
- Backward compatible

## Next Steps for Appointments Modal

The appointments modal needs to be improved with:
1. Better full-screen display
2. Professional action buttons
3. Smooth animations
4. Better spacing and layout

Would you like me to create the improved appointments modal now?
